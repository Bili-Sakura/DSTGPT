As a character gets hungrier, this meter will empty, and the stomach pictured will shrivel. The default maximum hunger for characters is measured at 150, though many characters have different maximum hunger amounts: Wolfgang (300) (200 ) WX-78 (100-200) (150-200 ) Wes (113) (75 ) Wagstaff (225) Wigfrid (120) Webber (175) Walani (200) Warly (250) Wilbur (175) Wilba (200) Wortox (175) Wurt (200-250) Walter (110) Wanda (175) Hunger drains at 9.375 points per minute or 75 points per game day, except for: Walani , drain hunger 10% faster (10.3125 or 82.5) Warly , drain hunger 33% faster (11.25 or 99.75) Wilbur , drain hunger 33% faster (11.25 or 99.75) only when running on all fours Warly , drain hunger 20% faster (11.25 or 90) Wes (singleplayer only), drain hunger 25% faster (12.46875 or 93.75) Wormwood , drain hunger 0%, 33%, 66%, 100% faster (9.375, 11.25, 15.5625, 18.75 or 75, 99.75, 124.6, 150) Wormwood , drain hunger 0%, 6%, 13%, 20% faster (9.375, 9.9375, 10.59375, 11.25 or 75, 79.5, 84.75, 90) Wolfgang (singleplayer only), drain hunger from 0 to 200% faster (from 9.375 to 28.125 or from 75 to 225) Wilba in her Werepig form , drain hunger 400% faster (46.875 or 375) Hunger drain can also be slowed or accelerated: To 60% of base rate by equipping a Belt of Hunger To 75% of base rate by wearing the Hibearnation Vest To 80% of base rate by poisoning To 75% of base rate by equipping Funcap If a Slurper jumps onto the player it will start draining 3 points of hunger every 2 seconds and keep doing so, until it's detached from the head slot. Walter loses only half the normal hunger when Sleeping. Winona will drain 5 hunger when she speed-crafts something. Wolfgang has faster hunger drain when using the Mighty Gym. WX-78 has 20% slower hunger drain when using the Super-Gastrogain Circuit. Wilson's belly growling When the Hunger meter is emptied, Health will begin to drain at 1.25 points per second until something is eaten or the character dies. Most food will restore the Hunger meter when eaten. The amount restored depends on the food eaten; cooked food typically restores more than raw food. Some food also has the potential to decrease Hunger, Sanity, or Health. Also, when going to sleep in a Straw Roll, Fur Roll, Tent, or a Siesta Lean-to, the character takes an immediate Hunger penalty.

        "text": "Caves |Featured articles, Gameplay, Sanity Loss English Français 中文 Caves Edit Edit source View history Talk (0) A cave sinkhole “What treasures lie beneath?” –Wigfrid Caves are large underground sections of world, generated as whole new worlds/shards upon entry. They have many unique features but also share some terrain, biomes, creatures, and plants with the surface world (such as a Marsh biome). Each cave has a Plugged Sinkhole entry and a separate map from the surface world. A loading screen displays for several seconds when entering or leaving the caves. Each Don't Starve Together server has a single Cave system that connects to all 10 sinkholes. Each sinkhole on the surface leads to a stairway in a different section of the caves. The stairways in the caves do not line up with the sinkholes on the surface world (adjacent sinkholes may lead to distant stairways and vice-versa). This sometimes creates useful shortcuts. In single-player, no time passes in the game while the loading screen displays upon entering or exiting the caves. In multiplayer, the game clock continues to run and other players experience no interruption while any one player (or players) sees the loading screen (while the character is going up or down the stairs). The cave world-shard contains the entire Ruins, meaning there is no sinkhole/boundary where the caves stop and ruins begin. Instead, the Lichen Meadow is the entrance to the Ruins in . Each sinkhole is surrounded by a few tiles of bare ground (no turf). Don't Starve has 3 separate Cave worlds; one for each sinkhole. Each cave has its own plugged entrance to a separate Ruins with an Ancient Guardian [Verification Needed]. No time passes in the game while the loading screen displays upon entering or exiting the caves [Verification Needed]. There are many Rocks strewn about the 10-20 tiles around each sinkhole. Contents 1 Spelunking 2 Depths Worm Attacks 3 Earthquakes 4 Creatures 5 Features 6 Death 7 Downloadable Content 8 Don't Starve Together 9 Trivia 10 Bugs 11 Gallery 12 References Spelunking[] A fully-explored Cave (older map) Caves can be found underneath a Plugged Sinkhole. Upon mining the plug with a Pickaxe, an open Sinkhole appears with a stairway (in , a rope leading down in ) into a new Cave. While within a Cave, time in the world above continues to pass and vice versa. In the Clock is visible all the time, while in it is removed in the game's HUD when not standing under a Cave Light, making it difficult to keep track of the current Day-Night Cycle. Once a Sinkhole is unplugged, Batilisks can emerge at Dusk and roam the surface world, but will not travel far from the Sinkhole from which they emerged. All 6 emerge in 3 seconds in . In , there are about 10 seconds between each Batilisk. In the sinkholes on the surface connect to stairway pillars in the caves. When a Sinkhole is entered in , the player drops into a small circle of light inside the Cave, with a rope hanging from above and a skeleton nearby. Interacting with the rope will return the player to the surface world. Though the surface light is not always visible, mobs such as Bunnymen, Spiders, and Moleworms become active/dormant according to the surface Day-Night Cycle. Caves shares the Winter with the surface world, but Summer is moderate without wildfires in the caves, like Spring or Fall. Caves may be affected by the Lunar Cycle in [Verification Needed], but in the moon does not reach the caves: Woodie and Pigs do not turn into their were-forms and the Moon Dial is always dark (like when there's a new moon on the surface). Most of the caves are perpetually in darkness with the usual Sanity drain and Charlie attacks. Natural light leak in from the surface in Cave Lights while it is daytime in the world above. Small patches of ground even receive enough light to grow Farm Plants! Caves are home to some additional light sources such as Light Flowers, Mushtrees, or Nightmare Fissures. But illuminated areas are the exception and players will need to bring their own sources of light (or night vision) to effectively explore the caves. Depths Worm Attacks[] In place of Hound and giant attacks, Depths Worms will attack the player at intervals similar to the Hound wave attacks on the surface, and will increase in intensity as the days spent in the caves increase. Like Hound attacks in the surface, Depths Worms will automatically target the player unless distracted by another mob. If a player skips a hound wave while spelunking, the wave may occur as soon as the player emerges from the cave. If a player skips the spawning of Deerclops or Bearger, it might also spawn upon resurfacing (sometimes skipping the warm-up \"growling\" period). Staying in a cave until the season changes will prevent the previous season's giant from attacking in this manner. Earthquakes[] Earthquakes occur every few days while the player is within a Cave. When an earthquake strikes, the screen shakes and a rumbling sound plays. Rocks, Flint, Nitre, Marble, Gold Nuggets, and sometimes Red and Blue Gems will fall from the Cave ceiling. In Rabbits and Moleworms fall from the ceiling as well (usually one each per earthquake). A small shadow will appear where each item is about to fall. If struck by a falling mineral, the player will take a small amount of damage. Many of the items that fall during an earthquake shatter when they hit the ground, but some will remain intact and can be collected by the player. Once the earthquake ends, Slurtles and Snurtles leave their homes and roam the Cave in search of minerals to eat. Creatures[] A Bunnyman In addition to normal Spiders, Fireflies, and Tentacles, the following creatures reside only in Caves: Cave Spider Spitter Batilisk Bunnyman / Beardlord Slurtle Snurtle A Spitter Rock Lobster Big Tentacle Baby Tentacle Depths Worm More creatures can only be found in the Ruins, below the Caves. Features[] Some surface plants can also be found in Caves, such as Saplings, Evergreens, Berry Bushes, Grass, and Mushrooms. However, several plants only grow underground: Light Flowers, Cave Banana Trees, Ferns, and Mushtrees (and its Red and Green variants). Like the above-ground versions, Berry Bushes and Grass will regrow after a few days. A spider infested Spilagmite A blue mushtree Stalagmites are a common sight in any cave, and can be mined for Rocks, Gold, and Flint. Similar-looking Spilagmites are home to Cave Spiders and Spitters, and can only be destroyed with a Pickaxe. Less common are the Slurtle Mounds, which spawn slow-moving Slurtles and, rarely, Snurtles. Additionally, stalactites and various rock formations can be seen in the dark areas of the caves. The 'heavenly light' that shines on the sinkhole when the player exits the caves. Nightmare Fissures can be encountered in the caves and appear as jagged cracks in the ground, emitting light. The amount of light they emit changes based on the Ruins' place in the Nightmare Cycle. When approached, the fissure will spawn a Shadow Creature nearby which can detect and attack the player regardless of their sanity level. Like the surface world, Set Pieces can appear in caves. These often include a skeleton and may even spawn advanced structures such as Ice Boxes, Science Machines, and Chests. The Exit From the Caves from Don't Starve Together. Death[] Life Giving Amulets, Touch Stones or Meat Effigies will revive the player as normal. Downloadable Content[] In the Reign of Giants DLC, Rabbits and Moleworms can fall from the ceiling during earthquakes, along with other items. They will be in their 'stunned' state as if they were just dropped by a player, but will behave as normal shortly afterwards. Don't Starve Together[] In Don't Starve Together, the Caves received some re-balances. Their generation algorithm has changed to be more like the surface world, having fewer dead-end corridors. Light Flowers now only light up when a player approaches them, and they now have a dormant state to prevent players from exploiting their limitless light. Since the ruins were moved to the same level of the caves, players must now have double caution when venturing through the darkness. Unlike Don't Starve that has 3 separate Cave worlds, Don't Starve Together only has one Cave world per server, with a single Ancient Guardian, but the ruins can be reset by killing the Ancient Fuelweaver The Toadstool can also be found in the caves. If a player is inside the caves during Summer, Cave-ins can occur which drop Boulders around the player. These are caused by the Antlion on the surface. Trivia[] In gameIn gameIn gameIn gameIn gameTexture Wall 1Texture Wall 2Texture Wall 3Texture Wall 4Texture Wall 5Texture Wall 6Texture Wall 4 with out bgTexture Wall 6 with out bg1/13 The Caves used to have giant walls, making it hard for the player to see. These were later removed. In the game files, unused wall textures can still be found. One of them is the wooden walls that were used for the Forbidden Knowledge short, and as interior decor for houses in the Hamlet DLC. These wooden walls were also used in an unfinished version of ruins, found in the files of the Hungry For Your Hunger update. When Caves were first released and the player died in one, they would reappear at the Sinkhole on the surface revived without the the use of any reviving items. The player could retrieve their lost items, but any food would turn into rot. Caves will often generate long stretches of ground that end up leading to nowhere. These can become deadly traps if the player is pursued down one. According to Maxwell's quotes, he plugged up the cave entrance \"a long time ago,\" and if the player mines it open, he will state that it was a bad idea to do so. Before the Game Update 165304 of Don't Starve Together, only dedicated servers could support caves, otherwise unplugged sinkholes would have roots blocking the path. On the subject of character unlocking in Don't Starve, Kevin said: \"I'm not against having a secret character unlock down in the depths of the cave, but it would probably end up being a more esoteric one, like Wortox or something else non-human\" Basing in the caves during summer prevents the player from overheating, but they must still be wary of cave-ins that replace Antlion sinkholes on the surface. To create convincing audio for the caves, Klei sent their audio department to the Britannia Mining Museum to record the sounds and impulses of a real life cave.[1] Photo of Britannia Mining Museum by Klei Bugs[] When dying in Caves or Ruins, exiting the game right at the death moment will cause the Cave or Ruins world to reset. Upon reloading, the player will spawn in a new Cave or Ruins world and lose all the items along. This bug can be exploited to make rare non-renewable items such as Green Gems and Thulecite renewable without using the Wooden Thing. This bug works only if the player doesn't have any resurrecting structures active. After sleeping in a cave, the morning tune and evening tune play at the same time. If the player starts a fire above the ground and then goes underground, no matter how much time is spent in the cave, the same fire will still be burning upon the player's return. If one gets killed while going up/down a sinkhole, and they have a Touch Stone activated or a Meat Effigy built at the surface, the world will forever be stuck in the loading screen. If the player plants seeds in a farm during Winter and then goes down into a cave, the crops will grow. Sometimes when leaving the caves the Seasons glitch and the player jumps two seasons ahead (Autumn instead of Spring, Winter instead of Summer, etc.). The day count is unaffected. Occasionally when entering the caves for the first time, a generated cave will not be saved after the player exits, causing a new cave world to be generated every time it is entered. When entering a sinkhole, players should be prepared for both scenarios of entering an existing cave and entering a new cave. Making structures in a cave or leaving rare items in a cave is not advised until after it can be confirmed that the generated cave is being saved.

He was released along with the Don't Starve vanilla Beta in late 2012 as the main protagonist and is the first playable character with a confirmed backstory. Wilson is an ambitious wannabe scientist with a sense of humor and a love for puns. He also has a peculiar haircut resembling the letter \"W\". Contents 1 Origin 2 Trivia 2.1 In-Game 2.2 Lore 2.3 Cultural References 3 References Origin “Say pal, looks like you're having some trouble! I have secret knowledge I can share with you, if you think you are ready for it.” –The radio's offer to Wilson in Forbidden Knowledge Don't Starve Forbidden Knowledge Wilson was the first of the playable characters to receive a backstory through an animated short, called Forbidden Knowledge. The events of this short were later officially summarized in DST's Compendium: While toiling away in his home laboratory late one night, Wilson was startled to hear a voice on the radio speaking directly to him. At first he feared he'd gone mad from too many late nights of experiments and accidentally-inhaled chemical fumes, but the voice assured him that it was no mere figment of the imagination. In fact, the voice had a proposition for him: if Wilson would build a machine according to their specifications, then he would be rewarded with secret knowledge, the likes of which no one had ever seen. Casting aside his better judgement [sic] (after all, what harm could come from making a vague bargain with a mysterious disembodied voice?) Wilson threw himself into constructing the machine. When at long last it was finally completed, the gentleman scientist had a moment of hesitation... a moment that might have saved him from his impending fate, had he been just a bit stronger of will. But at the voice's insistence, Wilson flipped the switch and activated his creation... and was never seen again. Well, at least not in this world. Trivia In-Game Wilson had his first appearance as a playable character in the Public Chrome Beta Test in the Google Chrome Store on May 18th, 2012. Wilson's voice is played by a \"Harmon muted trumpet (mixed with some cup muted trumpet as well)\". With a Puffy Vest, a Beefalo Hat and the Beard at full length, Wilson can have the highest insulation factor in the game at 615. Wilson is one of the only three characters that get an insulation bonus from their Beard. The other two are Webber from RoG (Reign of Giants), and Woodie when played in DST. Wilson is the only character capable of producing Beard Hair from shaving. His Beard is also the only one to allegedly be made of human hair. Wilson is the only character unaffected by the Strange New Powers update, aside from Maxwell, who was not finished in time and got his new powers later on in the All's Well That Maxwell update. Wilson is the only character with no drawbacks. Even in RoG, his Beard needs to be grown to accelerate overheating in Summer, which is not required of Wilson during that season. Wilson has a skull in the game files. Before the November 14, 2013 patch, Wilson used to share a lot of examination quotes with the other characters. His quotes are also used as the default for every other playable character when new objects are implemented in a beta stage. Wilson can be used as a Steam chat emoticon. Team Fortress 2 promoted Don't Starve with a hat modeled after Wilson's hair, as well as a weapon based on the Ham Bat. When struck by Lightning in DLCs, Wilson, like most other characters, is shown to have bones in his hair. Due to the short \"Inevitable,\" Wilson is one of the few characters to have received actual voice acting, along with Maxwell, Charlie, and Willow Wilson with Shadow Courtier can see Ink Blights names. Lore From June to July 2012, a series of blog posts featured field notes written in Wilson's point of view, in which he recorded his initial experiences building tools, encountering Beefalo, and creating Meat Effigies in The Constant. Kevin Forbes has described Wilson as \"a person of independent means who has decided to apply his intellect, such as it is, to science,\" and has stated that despite identifying as one, Wilson is not a good scientist.[1] Wilson's full name originates from promotional business cards Klei had made for a conference. Kevin Forbes originally wrote the name with Percival in mind for the middle initial \"P\".[2] With the original reveal of the Forbidden Knowledge video at the end of a puzzle, Wilson is the first character to be given a backstory through a cinematic. Wilson's age is in the early 30s.[3] While his birthplace was never set in stone, Wilson was roughly designed as a European immigrant and perhaps one in the United States.[4] An image of Wilson's face is visible in two Klei QR codes. One of them is part of a puzzle and links to an image of Maxwell, and the other is included on the tags of Don't Starve merchandise from the Klei Store and links to their main Don't Starve page. Wilson is one of the five playable characters whose full name is known, the others being Maxwell, Wheeler, Wagstaff and Wendy. According to Wilson's Guest of Honor skin description and quote in Don't Starve Together, he hates formal parties. Wilson may have medical knowledge, as in The Forge, he is capable of reviving allies twice as fast and with more health. In his examination quote for a Peg Leg, he also claims to be capable of performing amputations. His Victorian skin depicting him as a period physician could also be a hint towards this. Various quotes from Wilson show that he is obsessed with his hair. He says of a Straw Hat \"Hats always ruin my hair.\" According to his Umbrella examination quote from DST, he doesn't like his hair getting \"wet and poofy\". In The Gorge event in DST, a Streetlight \"reminds [him] of home\". Judging by his examination quote for Mumsy, Wilson had a nanny. Wilson's birthday is on April 23 as shown in the Compendium, the same day that Don't Starve was released. Wilson stars in the licensed game Don't Starve: Newhome, which takes place in a non-canonical version of the Don't Starve universe where he remains on the Nightmare Throne, maintaining control of The Constant. Sometimes a message like this may appear during the loading screen: \"Wilson chose the path of an independent Gentleman Scientist after finding the university environment to be too stifling for a man of his ambitions. (The enormous bill the university sent him to pay for repairs to the chemistry lab had absolutely nothing to do with this.)\", To the forum question \"there's art with 2 separate characters eating cup noodles, where did the cup noodles come from?\" developer nome replied: \"Wortox gave it to the Survivors because he thought it was cups of worms and would be a fun prank. He was very disappointed to find out it is, in fact, food. Nobody knows where he got them from.\"[5] His quote for the Coaching Whistle implies that in his youth, Wilson had awful experiences with gym classes. Cultural References Wilson is probably named after the iconic volleyball companion of Tom Hanks' character in the film Cast Away. This inspiration is shared with Rawling, a talking basketball item that is exclusive to the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. Wilson's middle name, Percival, originated as the name of one of the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian legends. A gentleman scientist was a term that arose in post-Renaissance Europe for a financially independent male scientist who pursued the study of science as a hobby.[6] The modern term is independent scientist. Wilson's Magmatic skin is based on Prince Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Wilson's Barber skin is based on Sweeney Todd from Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. His quote for the skin reflects this as well, as it is used in one of the songs from the musical. References ↑ Interview with Kevin Forbes by Jenesee Grey: (5:58) \"Wilson is a gentleman scientist, which was an actual thing back when. He's a person of independent means who has decided to apply his intellect, such as it is, to science. He's not actually a very good scientist. He's overconfident, a little brash. He's got a can-do attitude, but he can't actually follow up on a lot of things.\" Recorded on January 22, 2013, uploaded on February 18, 2013. ↑ Forum thread \"What means the P in the name?\" Kevin Forbes: \"I'm pretty sure it's Percival.\" / \"By pretty sure, I mean I think that's what I had in mind when I wrote the \"P.\" on the special promotional Wilson business cards that we got made for a conference, and from which Wilson got his name.\" Posted on October 9, 2012 ↑ Archive of Klei Entertainment confirming Wilson and Willow's age on Facebook: \"Wilson is in his early 30's.

It can be crafted at the beginning of the game with 1 Twig and 1 Flint. An Axe can also be used as a weapon, dealing 27.2 damage on each hit. With either usage, an Axe has enough durability for 100 swings. When used to chop down Trees, Axe requires 5 chops for small, 10 for medium, and 15 for large Trees. Dead or burnt Trees require only one swing. Currently, the amount of chopping required is independent of the type of the Tree.

It requires 4 Twigs and 2 Gold Nuggets to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. It has 400 uses, 4 times as many as the regular Axe. When used as a weapon it deals the same amount of damage as a regular Axe. It also has the same efficiency as the regular Axe, requiring 5, 10, and 15 chops to fell trees depending on their size.

It can be crafted with 2 Twigs and 3 Moon Shards, however doing so requires that the player to be close to the Celestial Altar. It is 2.5 times more efficient than the normal Axe. This means that Small Trees will take 2 hits, medium Trees will take 4 hits, and large Trees will take 6 hits to be chopped down. When used to attack shadow creatures, shadow pieces or Reanimated Skeletons it will lose less durability, and viceversa, it will lose more applications if used to attack any other unit. The Moon Glass Axe was introduced in the Turn of Tides update. Obsidian Axe Obsidian Axe \"Like a regular axe, only hotter.\" Crafting Recipe ×1 ×2 ×1 Tab Tier Combat attributes Damage 27.2 - 54.4 (20.4 - 40.8 )(34 - 68 )(13.6 - 108.8 ) Properties Durability 250 Uses Stacks up to Does not stack items Perk Reduces the amount of chops required to chop a tree.Gains charges for heat and light outside of Hurricane Season.Increased damage when charged.Emits light when charged.

It cuts AND burns?!” –Willow “The mightiest of axes!” –Wolfgang “It cuts and burns.” –Wendy “THIS AXE HAS FIRESTARTING FEATURES” –WX-78 “This tool generates its own heat.” –Wickerbottom “Watch out Lucy, you've got competition! (Just kidding!)” –Woodie “It seems to work best when alight.” –Maxwell “Incredible! The obsidian is converting kinetic energy into thermal energy.” –Wagstaff “Nöw THIS is an axe!” –Wigfrid “We'll be unstoppable!” –Webber “I gotta work to make you work...” –Walani “You really build up a head of steam swinging this!” –Warly “Keep thet away from me legs!” –Woodlegs “HARD BLADE FOR CHOP'TING!” –Wilba “Hard Chopper” –Wormwood “Well, that's certainly enlightening.” –Wheeler The Obsidian Axe is another version of Axe exclusive to Shipwrecked DLC. It requires 1 Axe, 1 Dragoon Heart, and 2 Obsidian to craft. The Obsidian Axe is also a possible reward from X Marks the Spot treasure chests. Like all items in the Volcanic Tab, it cannot be prototyped and the player must be wearing a Brain of Thought or be near an Obsidian Workbench to craft it again. The Obsidian Axe can be used to chop down Trees with 2.5 times the efficiency of the standard Axe, in addition to having 250 uses, which is 2.5 times of the uses for the standard version. Small Trees will take 2 hits, medium Trees will take 4 hits, and large Trees will take 6 hits to chop down. As the Obsidian Axe is used (either as a tool or a weapon), its charge level will increase. As the charge level increases, the Obsidian Axe will produce more heat and light, which protects the players from Charlie, but can cause Overheating. It can also be used as a weapon, initially dealing the same damage as the standard Axe per hit, but after gaining 75 charges, it will start igniting any target struck and deal up to 2x damage based on the number of charges. The charge level decreases over time as long as the axe isn't used and dropping it into the Ocean will completely remove its charge. An Obsidian Axe will not gain any charges during Hurricane Season. Similar to Thermal Stone, the Axe will start glowing as it gains charges. Players should take caution when using an Obsidian Axe with high levels of charge, as any Tree ignited by the Obsidian Axe can potentially ignite other nearby trees, resources or Structures. Burnt Trees can be chopped down with a single strike with any axe to obtain Charcoal, and the Obsidian Axe will not reignite the burnt tree or the Charcoal. When using this item as a weapon, players should remember that the Mobs that are killed while on fire will drop cooked variants of the food items and ashes for flammable resources they would otherwise drop. Some Mobs will also panic when on fire, running in random directions, potentially igniting other mobs, resources or Structures around them. Downloadable Content In the Shipwrecked DLC, Axes can be obtained from the Slot Machine and Steamer Trunk. Luxury Axes can be obtained from the Slot Machine and X Marks the Spot and by using a Trawl Net in the Ocean. In the Hamlet DLC, Axes can be bought for 5 Oincs at the Pigg and Pigglet's General Store in the Pig City. Three of them are also required to craft the Pigg and Pigglet's General Store using the Key to the City.

Once the player begins to chop the Tree, holding down the LMB or Spacebar will have the player character keep chopping until the Tree falls. Alternatively, one can chop faster by repeatedly clicking LMB with specific timing. In addition to chopping down trees, Axes are used in the following crafting recipes. Outside of chopping trees, the Axe can be a cheap tool to be used as a weapon for early game survival. 2× 1×2×1× 3×4×4× 1×2× The Gorge In The Gorge event for Don't Starve Together, an Axe can be found between two Fire Pits near the Mossy Gateway, next to two Logs. More Axes can be purchased from the Swamp Pig Elder for five Logs. Axes in The Gorge have infinite durability and have a Victorian-inspired appearance. This new appearance is available as a Skin. Trivia The Luxury Axe was added in the October 2, 2012 update. The Axe used to have a value of 1-10 Science Points depending on its durability when used on a Science Machine, while the Luxury Axe gave 1-35. Lucy the Axe, a character-specific item, is given to Woodie upon spawn. It acts as an infinite durability Axe that chops Trees much faster but does less damage. When the Luxury Axe is equipped, a 'ding' sound can be heard. In reality, gold is not a practical metal to be used in tools or weapons as it is a soft metal; it would easily deform and break. This is often remarked when examined by some Characters. Axes deal the same amount of damage as Boomerangs. A charged Obsidian Axe placed inside Chester, Packim Baggims, or Ro Bin will cause the follower to glow until the charge fades. Bugs When playing as Woodie in Shipwrecked, the Obsidian Axe can talk like Lucy.
